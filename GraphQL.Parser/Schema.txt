The files in the "Schema" folder define the interfaces and types we use to represent schemas,
schema-validated syntax trees, and the generic schema validation logic.

We represents schemas with an interface ISchema<'s>, where 's can be any type the schema wants to
extend the AST with. The same type is used to extend fields, arguments, directives, etc. so it is
not completely type-safe; a schema using this extension capability will likely have to implicitly
follow rules about which subtypes of 's it puts on each AST element.
